## Slide 11: Try Claude.ai + Gemini

**SHOW:**
- Title: "Time to get your hands dirty"
- URLs: `claude.ai` and `gemini.google.com`

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
> OK, open your laptops. We're doing three exercises. If you get stuck, raise your hand — I'll come around.

### Exercise 1: Sign Up & First Message (~10 min)

**Step-by-step instructions (SHOW on screen):**

#### Claude.ai
1. Go to **claude.ai** in your browser
2. Click **"Sign up"** (use your Google account or email — whatever's easiest)
3. Verify your email if needed
4. You should see a chat box. Type your first message:

```
I'm new here. Tell me one thing you can do that most people don't know about.
```

5. Read the response. Then try:

```
I have a job interview next week for a marketing manager position at a tech company. Give me 5 questions they're likely to ask and help me draft strong answers.
```

#### Gemini
1. Go to **gemini.google.com**
2. Sign in with your Google account (you probably already are)
3. Type the same two prompts and compare the responses to Claude's

**What to notice:**
- Different tone? Different level of detail?
- Did one ask you follow-up questions?
- Which response would you actually use?

## Slide 12: Same Task, Three AIs — Compare

**SHOW:**
- Title: "Exercise 2: The AI Taste Test"
- Have ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini all open in tabs

### Exercise 2: The Comparison (~15 min)

**Instructions (SHOW on screen):**

Pick ONE of these tasks (or use your own real task):

**Option A — Email Writer:**
```
Write a professional but warm email to a client named Sarah explaining that our project delivery will be 2 weeks late due to a supplier issue. Apologize without being overly apologetic. Keep it under 150 words.
```

**Option B — Decision Helper:**
```
I'm trying to decide between leasing and buying a car. I drive about 20,000 km/year, plan to keep the car 5+ years, and my budget is $500/month. Help me think through this — pros and cons for my situation.
```

**Option C — Learning Something New:**
```
Explain how mortgage interest rates work to someone who's buying their first home. Include what "fixed vs variable" means and what happens when rates go up. Use plain language.
```

**Instructions:**
1. Paste the SAME prompt into all three AIs
2. Read all three responses
3. On a piece of paper (or in your notes), answer:
   - Which response was most helpful to YOU?
   - Which was longest? Was longer actually better?
   - Did any AI ask a clarifying question instead of just answering?
   - Would you trust all three equally on this topic?

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
> Don't rush this. Actually read all three. The point isn't to find a winner — it's to develop your own taste. You'll start to notice: "Oh, I like how Claude structures things" or "Gemini gave me a detail the others missed." That intuition is valuable.

## Slide 13: Upload a Document + Image

**SHOW:**
- Title: "Exercise 3: AI Can Read Your Files"

### Exercise 3: Document & Image Upload (~15 min)

**Instructions (SHOW on screen):**

#### Part A: Upload a Document

1. Find a document on your computer — a PDF, Word doc, or even a long email you've saved. (If you don't have one handy, download the sample from [provide URL or have USB drives])
2. In **Claude.ai**: Click the **📎 paperclip icon** next to the message box
3. Select your file
4. Type one of these prompts:

```
Summarize this document in 5 bullet points. What are the key takeaways?
```

```
What are the three most important things I should pay attention to in this document?
```

```
Rewrite the main points of this document as if explaining to a 10-year-old.
```

**If you don't have a document, use this prompt instead:**
```
I'm going to paste a chunk of text. Summarize it, find any problems with the argument, and suggest improvements.

[Then paste any article text from a news site]
```

#### Part B: Upload an Image

1. Take a photo with your phone of ANYTHING nearby:
   - The whiteboard in this room
   - Your handwritten notes
   - A business card
   - A page from a book
   - Your lunch receipt
2. Send it to yourself (email, AirDrop, whatever) or use your phone's browser
3. Upload it to Claude or ChatGPT
4. Try these prompts:

```
What's in this image? Describe everything you see.
```

```
Read any text in this image and type it out for me.
```

```
[For a receipt] Calculate the total per person if split 3 ways with 15% tip.
```

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
> This is where it clicks for most people. When you realize AI can read your actual documents and look at your actual photos, it stops being a toy and starts being a tool.
>
> Common reactions: "Wait, it read my whole 20-page report?" Yes. "It can read my terrible handwriting?" Mostly, yes. "It figured out what's in my photo and answered my question about it?" Yes.
>
> Some things to try if you finish early:
> - Upload a photo of a plant and ask what species it is
> - Upload a screenshot of an error message and ask how to fix it
> - Upload a menu in another language and ask for a translation with recommendations
>
> This is the transition from "AI is fun to play with" to "AI actually saves me time." Hold onto that feeling — because in Part 6, we're going to set up a tool that makes this even more powerful.
