# Part 3: What AI Can Do
## Topic 8 | ~20 minutes

---

## Slide 8a: Image Generation

- Describe what you want → AI draws it in ~10 seconds
- ChatGPT has DALL-E; Gemini uses Imagen; Claude doesn't generate images
- Demo: "A watercolor golden retriever in a business suit at a corporate desk"
- Great for: social media graphics, presentations, mockups
- Not portfolio-quality but "good enough" for most needs

## Slide 8b: Voice — Talk to AI Like a Phone Call

- ChatGPT app → headphone icon → full voice conversation
- Natural sounding, maintains context, real back-and-forth
- Demo: "Explain AI to my 75-year-old mother-in-law who fears robots"
- Great for: hands-free (driving/cooking), accessibility, brainstorming
- This isn't Siri — it's a real conversation

## Slide 8c: Vision — AI Can See

- Upload any photo → AI identifies objects, reads text, understands context
- Demo 1: Photo of the room → describe everything
- Demo 2: Receipt → split 4 ways with constraints
- Demo 3: Error message screenshot → explain and fix
- Claude excels at vision; all three are strong
- Plant ID, handwriting OCR, foreign menus — all work
