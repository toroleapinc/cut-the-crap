## Slide 8a: Image Generation

**SHOW:** Side-by-side examples of AI-generated images
- Title: "AI can create images from words"

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
> Let's see what these things can actually do beyond text chat. Three capabilities most people don't know about or haven't tried.
>
> First: **image generation**. You describe what you want, AI draws it. Let me show you.

### Live Demo: Image Gen

**In ChatGPT (has DALL-E built in):**
```
Create a watercolor painting of a golden retriever wearing a tiny business suit, sitting at a desk in a corporate office, looking very serious
```

**What to show:**
- The image appears in ~10 seconds
- Point out: it understood "watercolor style," "tiny business suit," spatial arrangement
- Note: This is DALL-E inside ChatGPT. Claude doesn't generate images (yet). Gemini can via Imagen.

**Follow-up prompt:**
```
Now make the same dog but he's giving a TED talk to an audience of cats
```

**What to point out:**
- It can iterate on a concept
- It's not perfect — count the fingers on any humans, look for weird artifacts
- Practical uses: social media graphics, presentations, product mockups, fun

> Image gen is great for "good enough" visuals. It's not replacing graphic designers for polished work, but for a quick social post, a presentation image, or a concept mockup? Incredible.

## Slide 8b: Voice / Conversation

**SHOW:**
- Screenshot of ChatGPT voice mode interface
- Title: "You can TALK to AI — like a phone call"

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
> Second capability: **voice**. You can literally have a conversation with AI like you're on the phone.

### Live Demo: Voice

**On phone, open ChatGPT app:**
1. Tap the headphone icon (voice mode)
2. Say: "I'm trying to explain to my mother-in-law what AI is. She's 75 and thinks robots are taking over. Give me a simple, reassuring way to explain it."
3. Let it respond out loud
4. Follow up: "Now make it funnier"

**What to point out:**
- It sounds natural, not robotic
- It remembers context within the conversation
- Practical uses: hands-free while driving/cooking, accessibility, language practice, brainstorming while walking

> This isn't Siri giving you a Wikipedia snippet. This is a real back-and-forth conversation. My favorite use: when I'm driving and need to think through a problem, I just talk to it.

## Slide 8c: Vision — AI Can See

**SHOW:**
- Title: "Upload a photo. AI tells you what it sees."

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
> Third capability and maybe the most underrated: **vision**. You can show AI a photo and it understands what's in it.

### Live Demo: Vision

**Prepare in advance:** Take a photo of something in the room (a whiteboard with notes, a messy desk, a lunch menu)

**In Claude.ai (excellent at vision):**
1. Click the attachment/paperclip icon
2. Upload the photo
3. Type: `What do you see in this image? Be specific.`

**What to show:**
- It identifies objects, reads text, understands context
- It can read handwriting (mostly)
- It can describe diagrams and charts

**Second demo — practical use:**
Upload a photo of a restaurant receipt and type:
```
Split this bill 4 ways. Two people didn't drink alcohol. Calculate what each person owes including 18% tip.
```

**What to point out:**
- It read the receipt, understood line items, did the math, handled the constraint
- This is combining vision + reasoning + math in one shot

**Third demo — really cool:**
Upload a screenshot of an error message from your computer and type:
```
What does this error mean and how do I fix it? Explain like I'm not technical.
```

> Vision turns AI from "a thing I type to" into "a thing that can look at my world." Photo of a plant? It'll tell you what species and how to care for it. Photo of a rash? It'll suggest what it might be (with a disclaimer to see a doctor). Photo of a math problem your kid is stuck on? Solved.
>
> These three capabilities — image gen, voice, vision — are what separate "I've tried ChatGPT" from "I actually use AI." Most people are still just typing text back and forth. Now you know there's more.
