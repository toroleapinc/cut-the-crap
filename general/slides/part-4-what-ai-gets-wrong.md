## Slide 9: Hallucinations — When AI Is Confidently Wrong

- AI makes things up regularly, confidently, with perfect grammar
- Demo: Ask about fake case "Robertson v. McKenzie (1987)" → AI invents details
- Real-world: NY lawyer sanctioned for citing AI-generated fake cases
- HIGH risk: specific dates, names, statistics, niche domains
- LOW risk: general knowledge, creative tasks, reformatting your content
- Rule: AI is your first draft, never your final answer

### The 30-Second Verification Rule
1. 🔍 Google the specific claim
2. 🔄 Ask a second AI the same question
3. ❓ Ask the AI: "Are you sure? Source?"
4. 📋 For anything important: verify with a real source

## Slide 10: Privacy & Data

| Service | Trains on Your Data? | Notes |
|---------|---------------------|-------|
| ChatGPT (free) | Yes by default | Opt out in Data Controls |
| ChatGPT Plus | Yes by default | Toggle off in settings |
| Claude.ai | No (by default) | Anthropic doesn't train on conversations |
| Gemini | Yes | Tied to Google account |
| API (OpenClaw) | No | Paying customers ≠ training data |

### Rules of Thumb
- ✅ SAFE: Public info, creative writing, general questions
- ⚠️ THINK TWICE: Client details, strategies, financial info, NDAs
- ❌ NEVER: Passwords, credit cards, SIN numbers, medical records with names
- Bottom line: treat AI like a smart coworker you don't fully trust yet
