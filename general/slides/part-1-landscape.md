## Slide 1: There's More Than ChatGPT

**SHOW:**
- Three logos side by side: ChatGPT (OpenAI) · Claude (Anthropic) · Gemini (Google)
- Tagline: "ChatGPT is **one** AI. There are three major ones worth knowing."

**SAY:**
> Raise your hand if you've used ChatGPT. Now keep your hand up if you've also tried Claude or Gemini. Most hands drop — that's normal.
>
> - **ChatGPT** — Made by OpenAI. The one everyone knows. Currently running GPT-5.2 (Dec 2025) as its flagship. Great all-rounder, best ecosystem.
> - **Claude** — Made by Anthropic. Latest: Claude Opus 4.6 (Feb 2026) and Sonnet 4.6 (Feb 2026). Best at long documents, writing, analysis. Less hallucination.
> - **Gemini** — Made by Google. Gemini 3 Pro (Nov 2025) with 1M token context. Deeply integrated with Google services.
>
> None is "the best." By end of today you'll know when to use which.

## Slide 2: Live Comparison — Same Prompt, 3 AIs

**SHOW:** Three browser windows side by side

**Demos:**
1. Creative: "Write a 4-sentence horror story about a smart home that becomes too smart."
2. Factual: "Three biggest acquisitions in Canadian tech history — year and price."
3. Practical: "Dinner for 8 on $100 — 2 vegetarians, 1 gluten-free. Menu + shopping list + timeline."

**SAY:**
> Watch for: tone, confidence, formatting, accuracy. Which would you actually USE?

## Slide 3: The Brain vs The App

**SHOW:**

| App (The Netflix) | Brains Available (The Shows) |
|---|---|
| ChatGPT | GPT-5.2, GPT-5.1, GPT-4o, o3, o4-mini |
| Claude.ai | Claude Opus 4.6, Sonnet 4.6, Haiku 4.5 |
| Gemini | Gemini 3 Pro, Gemini 2.0 Flash |
| **OpenClaw** | **ALL of the above** |

**SAY:**
> Netflix analogy: the app delivers content, but the shows (models) are what matter. One app can run different brains. The same brain can run in different apps. OpenClaw = Netflix + Disney+ + HBO in one app.
