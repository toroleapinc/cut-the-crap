## Slide 1: There's More Than ChatGPT

**SHOW:**
- Three logos side by side: ChatGPT (OpenAI) · Claude (Anthropic) · Gemini (Google)
- Tagline: "ChatGPT is **one** AI. There are three major ones worth knowing."

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
> Raise your hand if you've used ChatGPT. [most hands go up] Now keep your hand up if you've also tried Claude or Gemini. [most drop]
>
> That's totally normal. ChatGPT had a massive head start — it launched November 2022 and became the fastest-growing app in history. But here's the thing: there are now three serious players, and they're all good at different things.
>
> - **ChatGPT** — Made by OpenAI. The one everyone knows. Great all-rounder, best ecosystem (plugins, GPTs, image gen built in).
> - **Claude** — Made by Anthropic. Tends to be more careful, better at long documents, excellent at writing and analysis. Less likely to make stuff up.
> - **Gemini** — Made by Google. Deeply integrated with Google services. Good at research, can access current info, handles images well.
>
> None of these is "the best." They're like different restaurants — sometimes you want sushi, sometimes you want pizza. By the end of today you'll know when to use which one.

## Slide 2: Live Comparison — Same Prompt, 3 AIs

**SHOW:**
- Three browser windows/tabs open side by side: chat.openai.com, claude.ai, gemini.google.com
- Title: "Same question. Three answers. Let's see what happens."

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
> Let's do this live. I'm going to type the exact same prompt into all three and we'll see how they differ. Watch the style, the length, the confidence, and the accuracy.

### Demo Prompt 1: Creative Writing (Shows personality differences)

**Type into all three:**
```
Write a 4-sentence horror story about a smart home that becomes too smart.
```

**What to point out:**
- ChatGPT: Usually dramatic, punchy, goes for the twist ending
- Claude: Often more literary, might add psychological depth
- Gemini: Tends to be concise, sometimes adds a disclaimer about fiction

> See? Same prompt, three different personalities. None is wrong — they just have different vibes.

### Demo Prompt 2: Factual/Research (Shows accuracy differences)

**Type into all three:**
```
What were the three biggest acquisitions in Canadian tech history? Include the year and price for each.
```

**What to point out:**
- Check if all three agree on the facts
- Note which one hedges ("I believe..." vs stating as fact)
- Note which one provides sources or says "I should verify this"
- If any get a fact wrong — GREAT teaching moment

> This is where it gets interesting. When you need facts, notice which AI is confident and which is cautious. Cautious is sometimes better — we'll talk about that in Part 4.

### Demo Prompt 3: Practical Task (Shows usefulness differences)

**Type into all three:**
```
I'm hosting 8 people for dinner on a $100 budget. I need a menu with a shopping list and timeline for cooking. Everyone eats different things — 2 vegetarians, 1 gluten-free.
```

**What to point out:**
- Who gives the most practical, actionable answer?
- Who formats it best (tables, timelines)?
- Who asks clarifying questions vs just diving in?
- Who stays within the budget constraint?

> This is a real-world task. Notice which AI actually gives you something you could hand to someone and say "go shop." That's the difference between impressive and useful.

## Slide 3: The Brain vs The App

**SHOW:**
```
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│          THE APP                  │
│   ChatGPT · Claude · Gemini      │
│   (the website you talk to)      │
│                                   │
│   ┌──────────────────────────┐   │
│   │       THE BRAIN           │   │
│   │   GPT-4o · Claude Sonnet  │   │
│   │   Gemini Pro · etc.       │   │
│   │   (the AI model inside)   │   │
│   └──────────────────────────┘   │
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
> This is the single most important concept today. I'm going to use an analogy.
>
> Think of **Netflix**. Netflix is the app — the thing on your TV with the red logo. But Netflix doesn't make all its own shows. It has shows from different studios, different directors, different budgets. Netflix is the **delivery system**. The shows are the **content**.
>
> AI works the same way:
> - **ChatGPT** is like Netflix — it's the app, the website, the thing you open.
> - **GPT-4o** is like a show on Netflix — it's the actual AI brain doing the thinking.
>
> Why does this matter? Because:
> 1. One app can run DIFFERENT brains. ChatGPT lets you pick between GPT-4o (smart) and GPT-4o-mini (fast/cheap).
> 2. The SAME brain can run in DIFFERENT apps. You can use Claude's brain through Claude.ai OR through other tools (like OpenClaw, which we'll see later).
>
> Right now, when you open ChatGPT, you're using ONE app with ONE company's brains. That's like only watching Netflix and never checking if the same movie is on a better app. By the end of today, you'll be able to pick the best brain for each job, regardless of which app it lives in.

**SHOW (follow-up):**

| App (The Netflix) | Brain (The Show) |
|---|---|
| ChatGPT | GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, o1, o3 |
| Claude.ai | Claude Sonnet, Claude Haiku, Claude Opus |
| Gemini | Gemini Pro, Gemini Flash |
| **OpenClaw** | **All of the above** ← this is where we're headed |

> See that last row? That's the goal today. One tool that lets you pick any brain. Like having Netflix, Disney+, and HBO all in one app.
