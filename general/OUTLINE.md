# Cut the Crap — Everything You Need to Know About AI
## General Audience: Single 4-Hour Session

### Part 1: The Landscape (Feb 2026)
1. There's more than ChatGPT — meet Claude & Gemini
2. Live comparison: same prompt, 3 AIs
3. The Brain vs The App (models vs interfaces)

### Part 2: How It Works
4. Models: fast/cheap vs smart/expensive (GPT-5.2, Sonnet 4.6, Gemini 2.5 Pro)
5. Free tiers vs paid — pricing truth (free now has ads on ChatGPT!)
6. What's an API key — pay-as-you-go, you see exact cost, for custom programs this is the ONLY option
7. OAuth vs API key — OAuth lets apps (OpenClaw, Claude Code) use your existing subscription (Pro/Max plan), no extra cost but tokens count against limits; API key = pay per token, see exact dollar cost

### Part 3: What AI Can Do
8. Image gen, voice, vision, Deep Research, agents (quick demos)

9. Hallucinations — when AI is confidently wrong + how to verify
10. Privacy & data — where does your stuff go

### Part 5: Hands-On
11. Try Claude.ai + Gemini
12. Same task across 3 AIs — compare
13. Upload a doc + image, ask questions

### Part 6: Getting Ready for OpenClaw
14. What is a Markdown file? (and why AI tools love it)

16. Meet OpenClaw — live demo on phone
17. Switch models, show cost
